## Installation
To install, clone down the repository. You will need to to remove the '.example' from 'env.example' and add your mongoDB uri to it in order to deploy, though this will not be necessary for developing locally.

## Usage
To use locally, open the root directory in the terminal and use 'npm run start' to transpile the code into js and start the database and server. From there, routes can be tested via localhost:3001.

A demonstration of testing api endpoints can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NF6YlgNi7xOmMcANF4W9EqduTntJeqJ0/view?usp=sharing)
